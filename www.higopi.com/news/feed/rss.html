			<description><![CDATA[<p>Are you the website owner/administrator of a website with various Tamil encodings (like TAB/TAM/TSCII) ? Always wondering how you can completely convert your website to Unicode Tamil? Then here is your easiest solution called "Adhiyaman for websites" a tool you can use for free. </p><br /> <p> This tool is used for converting the entire website (or a particular directory and its sub directories) which has content based on various Tamil encodings (like TAB/TAM/TSCII) to Unicode Tamil. If you are a web master or owner of a website which is based on various Tamil encodings (like TAB/TAM/TSCII) and would like to convert all your content from TAB/TAM/TSCII to Unicode Tamil, this is the tool for you. This tool need to be uploaded to your website and need to be run from there. This tool will convert the files in your web server. This is not a tool for converting your client side HTML files.</p> <br /> <p> I would like to thank Mr. Ulagan and Mr.Ira.Kumaran from World Socialist Website (http://www.wsws.org/tamil/) for giving me the idea and requirement. I would also like to thank Mr.Mugunth, Mr.Krupa Shankar, Mr. Amala Singh, Mr. Mu.Mayuran and Mr. Ka.Sethu for testing the pre-release and providing ideas and requirements for the next release of this tool.</p>  <br /><p>Please spread a word about this tool to your friends who are the owner/administrators of websites with various Tamil encodings (like TAB/TAM/TSCII). If you want to report any bugs in this tool, please mail me your bug with details.</p> <br /> <p><font color="#006600"><strong>I wish all the World Tamilians a Happy Pongal and New Year</strong></font></p>]]></description>

			<link>http://www.higopi.com/converters-popup-help.html</link>
			<guid>http://www.higopi.com/converters-popup-help.html</guid>
			<description><![CDATA[You might have noticed a online key combination help popup when you use the Unicode Indic converters in this website. Due to the buggy display of online help and key map, The way it displays has been modified. Now, the online help is displayed on top of the textarea where you enable Tamil typing.  The map position also made dynamic to show just a bit below the current active scrolled window, Hence it will be visible to the user. <br /><br />If you are using these converters offline or for tamil typing in any of your websites, Please download the latest ucedit.zip in the downloads section (or you can also download and overwrite the updated code from <a href="http://www.higopi.com/script/ucedit/common.js">http://www.higopi.com/script/ucedit/common.js </a>]]></description>
